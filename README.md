# Team-Generator

## Description

This is a command line application that runs using NodeJS, and NPM packages such as Inquirer which I used to prompt users with an array of objects for the questions. Also, this application uses the Node package 'Jest' for unit testing.

## Installation

For this application I was provided with the  starter code with contained the main JS file, testing files, and acceptance criteria. 

Afterwards, I installed the correct packages such as Inquirer and Jest so that my prompts within the JS file would run on Node; I did this by running a NPM install command with both packages.

Finally, I setup a remote repo on Github to work from, which I then cloned to my local repository so I can have the two in sync.
